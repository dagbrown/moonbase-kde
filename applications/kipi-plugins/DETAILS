Note: Since Digikam 6 they have been deprecated by Digikam in favour of their
new plugin framework DPlugins called Purpose.

However Kipi Plugins are still supported by KDE apps KPhotoAlbum, Gwenview,
Spectacle so they shouldn't disappear yet.

This will become part of KDE Applications in its next release scheduled for
August and will follow the KDE Applications version numbers.
