cat << EOF
Akonadi is a PIM layer, which provides an asynchronous API to access all kind
of PIM data (e.g. mails, contacts, events, todos etc.).
It consists of several processes (generally called the Akonadi server) and a
library (called client library) which encapsulates the communication between
the client and the server.
This directory contains the sources of the Akonadi server and all the
infrastructure that is needed to build the client libraries and the application
which want to make use of Akonadi.
