cat << EOF
Phonon provides a multimedia API for KDE developers while at the same time giving the users more
choices. With Phonon applications don't need to develop sound engines as Phonon provides them
for free. Applications are written saying what they want and not how they want to do it. This
leaves some room for the user/administrator to customize things. If you need multimedia
functionality in your program, Phonon is for you. Use it from simple audio playback to full
blown video playback with audio and video effects. Use it to record an audio signal or capture
from a webcam. Use it to concentrate on your program and not on getting the mediaframework to work for you.
