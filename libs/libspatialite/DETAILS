cat << EOF
SpatiaLite is an open source library intended to extend the SQLite core to support fully
fledged Spatial SQL capabilities.
SQLite is intrinsically simple and lightweight:

Aa single lightweight library implementing the full SQL engine standard SQL implementation:
almost complete SQL-92
no complex client/server architecture
a whole database simply corresponds to a single monolithic file (no size limits)
any DB-file can be safely exchanged across different platforms, because the internal
architecture is universally portable
no installation, no configuration
