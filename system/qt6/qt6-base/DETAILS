cat << EOF
Qt is a C++ toolkit for application development. It lets application developers
target all major operating systems with a single application source code.
Qt provides a platform-independent API to all central platform functionality:
GUI, database access, networking, file handling, etc.
The Qt library encapsulates the different APIs of different operating systems,
providing the application programmer with a single, common API for all
operating systems. The native C APIs are encapsulated in a set of well-designed,
fully object-oriented C++ classes.
