cat << EOF
The Extra CMake Modules package, or ECM, adds to the modules provided by CMake,
including both ones used by ``find_package()`` to find common software and ones
that can be used directly in ``CMakeLists.txt`` files to perform common tasks.

In addition, it provides common build settings used in software produced by the
KDE community.
