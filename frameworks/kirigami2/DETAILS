Kirigami is a set of QtQuick components at the moment targeted for mobile use 
(in the future desktop as well) targeting both Plasma Mobile and Android. It’s
not a whole set of components, all the “Primitive” ones like buttons and textboxes
are a job for QtQuickControls (soon QtQuickControls2) but it’s a set of high level
components to make the creation of applications that look and feel great on mobile
as well as desktop devices and follow the Kirigami Human Interface Guidelines.
