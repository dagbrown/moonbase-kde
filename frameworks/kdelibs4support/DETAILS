cat << EOF
This framework provides code and utilities to ease the transition from
kdelibs 4 to KDE Frameworks 5.  This includes CMake macros and C++
classes whose functionality has been replaced by code in CMake, Qt and
other frameworks.

Code should aim to port away from this framework eventually.  The API
documentation of the classes in this framework and the notes at
<http://community.kde.org/Frameworks/Porting_Notes> should help with
this.
