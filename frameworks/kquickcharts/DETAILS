cat << EOF
The Quick Charts module provides a set of charts that can be used from QtQuick
applications. They are intended to be used for both simple display of data as
well as continuous display of high-volume data (often referred to as plotters).
The charts use a system called distance fields for their accelerated rendering,
which provides ways of using the GPU for rendering 2D shapes without loss of
quality.
